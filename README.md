# Weather_Analysis

This analysis focused around obtaining weather, city, and hotel information from OpenWeatherMap and Google APIs and using that information to map a number of different things.

## Weather_Database

The first part of the challenge consisted of using the OpenWeatherMap API to get the weather information for 650+ cities based on a random set of longitudes and latitudes.

The data collected was then used to create a map of potential Customer Travel Destinations as well as a Travel Itinerary Map.

## Customer Travel Destinations Map

The second part of the challenge involved calling the Google API to get a list of hotels that were close to the cities found in the prior part of the challenge.

The name, city, country, max temp, and description of today's weather were then added to a map with markers that could be clicked on to get more information about each destination. 

## Travel Itinerary Map

The last part of the challenge involved selecting four cities near each other and creating a travel itenerary that maps out a loop between all four cities. 

This required the use of the Google Directions API.
